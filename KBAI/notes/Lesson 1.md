# Lesson 1

## Overview
- Conundrums in and characteristics of AI
- KBAI and the four schools of AI
- Cognitive Systems
- Topcs in AI

## Conundrums in AI
- Intelligent agents have limited resources
  - Most AI problems are intractable
  - How can we give near real time performance on these problems?
- Computation is local, but problems have global constrains
  - How can we get the agents to address global problems using only local competition
- Logic is deductive but many problems are not
  - How can we solve inductive, abductive etc problems?
- The world is dynamic but knowledge is limited
  - How can an agent solve a new problem?
- Problem solving, reasoning and learing are complex but explanation and justification are even more complex
  - How can we get an agent to ever explain or justify its decisions?
